## Project 2 Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this project, participants will:

- Develop proficiency in using Git through both the command line interface (CLI) and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Source Control.
- Gain practical experience in writing and executing Node.js JavaScript code for non-web server applications.
- Practice refactoring JavaScript code to improve code quality and maintainability.

## Overview

### Project Elements:

1. **Git Proficiency:**
   - Participants will utilize the CLI to create and manage a Git repository (repo), fostering a solid understanding of version control concepts.

2. **Refactoring Practice:**
   - Building on previous JavaScript experience, participants will refactor code from the previous project, honing their skills in improving code structure and readability.

3. **Visual Studio Code Integration:**
   - Leveraging VSCode's Source Control functionality, participants will interact with Git within the familiar environment of their code editor.

4. **.gitignore Utilization:**
   - Participants will create and utilize a .gitignore file to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git, ensuring cleaner version control.

5. **Diff Split Screen:**
   - Exploring Git's diff functionality, participants will utilize the split-screen feature to visualize and compare changes made to their code.
