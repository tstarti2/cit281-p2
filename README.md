# Project 2: Git 

For Project 2, I aimed to accomplish several key learning objectives:

## Learning Objectives

- **Proficiency with Git:**
  I focused on mastering Git, both through the command line interface (CLI) and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Source Control. This involved creating and managing Git repositories, which deepened my understanding of version control concepts.

- **Node.js Coding Practice:**
  I continued to hone my Node.js JavaScript coding skills, particularly for non-web server applications. This allowed me to gain practical experience in writing and executing JavaScript code.

- **Code Refactoring:**
  Building on my previous JavaScript experience, I engaged in refactoring code from the previous project. This practice helped me improve code quality and maintainability by restructuring and enhancing readability.

## Overview of Project Elements

1. **Git Proficiency:**
   I utilized the CLI to manage Git repositories, solidifying my understanding of version control concepts.

2. **Refactoring Practice:**
   I refined my skills in code restructuring and readability by refactoring JavaScript code from the previous project.

3. **Visual Studio Code Integration:**
   Leveraging VSCode's Source Control functionality, I seamlessly interacted with Git within the code editor.

4. **.gitignore Utilization:**
   I created and utilized a .gitignore file to ensure cleaner version control by specifying files and directories to be ignored by Git.

5. **Diff Split Screen:**
   I explored Git's diff functionality, utilizing the split-screen feature in VSCode to visualize and compare code changes effectively.

This project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in Git usage, Node.js coding, and code refactoring, further enhancing my development skills.
